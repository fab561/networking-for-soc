# Packet Tracer – Basics

## What is Packet Tracer
Packet Tracer is a network simulation tool used to build and test network topologies virtually.

It allows you to:
- Add routers, switches, PCs
- Connect devices with cables
- Configure IP addresses
- Simulate packet movement

## Why it is useful
It helps visualize how devices communicate without real hardware.

## Key concepts learned
- Devices must be connected properly
- IP configuration is required for communication
- Physical connections matter (correct cable type)
- You can simulate packet flow

## SOC relevance
Understanding Packet Tracer helps visualize how traffic flows through devices, which improves investigation skills.

## Example scenario
If a PC cannot reach a server:
- Check IP configuration
- Check cable connections
- Check routing
