# Network Devices

## Core concepts from Video 1

### Network
A network is a group of connected devices that communicate and share resources.

### Router
Connects different networks and routes traffic (example: home network → internet).

### Switch
Connects devices inside the same network and forwards data using MAC addresses.

### Firewall
Filters traffic based on security rules to allow or block connections.

### Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
Advanced firewall that can inspect applications, detect threats, and perform intrusion prevention.

### Server
Provides services or resources (web, email, database) to other devices.

### Client
A device that requests services from a server (laptop, phone, browser).

### Client–Server Relationship
Clients request → servers respond.  
Most internet communication follows this model.

### Cloud / Internet symbol
Represents external networks or services outside the local environment.

### Example infrastructure
Clients → Switch → Router → Firewall → Internet/Cloud → Servers
